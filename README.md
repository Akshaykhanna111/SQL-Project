# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The objective of this project is to study the data of an ecommerce platform and derive insights from it that can help make strategic business decisions and highlight issues pertaining to customer experience. The data points provided for analysis comprises of web session details, user activity logs and product related information like inventory turnover ratio and customer sentiment. It's an open ended problem statement with few specific scenarios wherein particular information is required from the data analyst regarding revenue across categories, cities and countries. 

## Process
Below I have entailed the methodology adopted while working on this project - 
1. Data understanding - Study the 5 files shared for this project and go through each attribute to get a flavour of what data points are available for analysis.
2. Go through the questions shared for the project to identify the key parameters on which insights are required. Also, identify additional data points that might be of high significance from an analysis standpoint.
3. In the current form and shape validate whether any data normalization is required or the current table strucutres are already 3NF compliant. 

## Results
